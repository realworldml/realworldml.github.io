<p><strong>Title:</strong> Data-Driven Optimization of Particle Accelerators with Safety Constraints</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tuning machine parameters of particle accelerators is a repetitive and time-consuming task that is challenging to automate. While many off-the-shelf optimization algorithms are available, their use is limited in practice because most methods need to account for safety-critical constraints in each iteration, such as loss signals or step-size limitations. One notable exception is Bayesian optimization, a data-driven tuning approach for global optimization with noisy feedback. We propose a Bayesian optimization algorithm (SafeLineBO) that combines line search techniques and safety constraints, and exhibits favourable properties in high-dimensional settings. We evaluate our method on two particle accelerators of the Paul Sherrer Institute, demonstrating efficacy and efficiency for tuning up to 16 parameters subject to 224 constraints.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Automated Experimental Design of Tokamak Rampdowns using Bayesian Optimization</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tokamaks typically operate in discrete shots lasting a short period of time. In these shots, the plasma current must be ramped up to a flat top current at which physics experiments and ultimately fusion reactions will occur. Before the available change in flux of the current drive mechanism is exhausted or if there is an emergency necessitating an early shutdown, the current must be safely ramped down to a low level before the plasma disrupts and deposits its energy on the vessel wall. On the next generation of tokamaks it is essential that this is done safely as the device could be damaged by the stored electrical or magnetohydrodynamic energy present in the plasma. Typically the ramp-down phase of a shot consists of a decrease in current and injected power and optionally a change in shape, but there is considerable flexibility in the rate, sequencing, and duration of these changes. In this work, we give a procedure for automatically choosing experimental rampdown designs to rapidly converge to a good design of the rampdown phase using probabilistic machine learning methods and acquisition function techniques taken from Bayesian Optimization. In our experiments at DIII-D over the course of 2022, we found that there is a clear and statistically significant reduction in current and energy at the end of the rampdown in comparison to baseline operations when using rampdown designs generated by the model at the end of shots. We also find that the best action predicted by the model significantly improved as the model was able to explore over the course of the experimental campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Experimental Design and Domain Expertise: The Essential Ingredients for Robot Learning</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Artificial intelligence researchers have long sought to embed learning abilities in robotic systems. We identify three stages of developing intelligent agents: (1) prior engineering, where knowledge is built in by experts; (2) skill learning by experimenting; and (3) adaptation to new situations. We demonstrate examples of these stages on complex long-horizon robot manipulation tasks. In particular, we show how data efficient learning can be enabled by combining domain expertise and experimental design. Finally, we discuss the Bayesian alignment problem, which is how to align Bayesian priors in intelligent systems with expert beliefs, so that we can better understand and control the behaviors of these systems.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Active materials discovery for sustainable energy storage</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf33NP4H2-k" title="Kevin Tran"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/qf33NP4H2-k/0.jpg" alt="Kevin Tran" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We may be able to slow the effects of climate change by transitioning from fossil fuels to solar energy, but solar energy’s inconsistent availability makes implementation difficult. This could be addressed by storing the energy in solar fuels, which are fuels created from solar energy, CO₂, and H₂O. Unfortunately, solar fuels are hindered by insufficiently mature material technologies. In this talk, we discuss two past studies where we used active learning to discover catalysts for solar fuel production. We then review several other examples of active learning in the materials informatics community. We end by discussing open issues with active learning in the materials informatics community.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Combinatorial Bayesian Optimisation with Applications to Antibody discovery and Logic Synthesis EDA</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iED-JUdapGs" title="Haitham Bou Ammar"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/iED-JUdapGs/0.jpg" alt="Haitham Bou Ammar" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many critical emerging real-world problems are instances of combinatorial optimisation with an expensive-to-evaluate (non-linear) black-box objective. Examples are widespread, including machine learning, robotics, medicine and chip design scenarios. In those cases, standard combinatorial solvers, e.g., simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, face difficulties due to the high-sample complexity associated with their heuristics. In this talk, we will elaborate on new combinatorial solvers that extend Bayesian optimisation to discrete spaces and can handle expensive-to-evaluate (non-linear) black-box objectives. We detail Gaussian process kernels that operate in combinatorial spaces and illustrate effective acquisition optimisation techniques over discrete domains. We then apply such solutions to two real-world use cases from antibody design and logic synthesis EDA. Our results demonstrate effective solutions leading us to rank 1 in the EPFL logic synthesis benchmark in 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> RLHF: Reinforcement Learning with Once-per-Episode Feedback</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5iiDNql9Ss" title="Aldo Pacchiano"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/Z5iiDNql9Ss/0.jpg" alt="Aldo Pacchiano" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite Reinforcement learning’s remarkable success in several application and simulation domains, research in the field has barely ventured beyond the typical modeling assumptions underlying the MDP formalism. In this work we aim to reimagine the way in which rewards are produced by moving away from the typical setting of per-step Markovian rewards to a model that instead produces a binary score acting at the trajectory level. While this is an extreme test case for theory, it is also arguably more representative of real-world applications than the traditional requirement in RL practice that the learner receive feedback at every time step. Indeed, in many real-world applications of reinforcement learning, such as self-driving cars, and robotics, it is easier for a human labeler to evaluate whether a learner’s complete trajectory was either “good” or “bad,” but harder to provide a reward signal at each step. To show that learning is possible in this more challenging setting, we study the case where trajectory labels are generated by an unknown parametric model and provide a statistically and computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sub-linear regret. We will also comment on how to extend these results to the dueling setting where a human labeler decides which one of two trajectories is better.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> GFlowNet, short for Generative Flow Network, is a new generative modeling framework which we think is particularly suited for discrete, combinatorial objects. The idea behind GFN is to estimate (graph-theoretic) flows in a directed acyclic network. The network represents all possible ways of constructing an object, and so knowing the flow gives us a policy which we can follow to sequentially construct objects in an energy-based fashion (i.e., objects are drawn proportionally to some quantity, like a reward or unnormalized density). In this talk I’ll present the framework, the intuition behind it, some nice properties it has, some cool things we can do with it and some really cool avenues for future work such as drug discovery.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Composite Bayesian Optimization for Efficient and Scalable Adaptive Experimentation</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Experimentation is ubiquitous in science and a key driver of human progress. Many experimentation tasks can be cast as optimization problems with expensive or time-consuming to evaluate objective functions. Bayesian optimization has emerged as a powerful tool for tackling such problems. However, many experimentation tasks arising in high-stakes applications such as materials design and drug discovery are out of the reach of standard approaches. In this talk, I will describe recent advances that aim to address this challenge. In particular, I will focus on how the composite structure of many experimentation tasks can be exploited to improve the efficiency and scalability of Bayesian optimization methods. Finally, I will provide directions for future research toward a general framework for efficient end-to-end adaptive experimental design in complex settings.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Lessons learned in deploying bandit algorithms</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM4oIVd85Nk" title="Kevin Jamieson"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/RM4oIVd85Nk/0.jpg" alt="Kevin Jamieson" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bandit algorithms, and adaptive experimentation more generally, promise the same statistically significant guarantees as, say, non-adaptive A/B testing, but require far fewer trials which results in a savings in time and money. However, such promises hold only under assumptions that rarely hold in practice, and for algorithms that may require unrealistic data interaction patterns. This talk explores this tension through two case studies in deploying state of the art algorithms to a large online experimentation platform and a robotics application in an industrial setting. Problems will be discussed, sensible solutions will be proposed, and opinions will be offered.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Inference after Adaptive Sampling for Longitudinal Data</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3Hw6BCySXY" title="Kelly W. Zhang"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/o3Hw6BCySXY/0.jpg" alt="Kelly W. Zhang" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Online algorithms that learn to optimize treatments over time are increasingly used in a variety of digital intervention problems. These algorithms repeatedly update parameter estimates as data accrues; these parameter estimates are used to inform treatment decisions. These algorithms are called “adaptive sampling” algorithms and the resulting data is considered “adaptively collected.” In this work, we focus on data collected by a large class of adaptive sampling algorithms that are designed to optimize treatment decisions online using accruing data from multiple users. Combining or “pooling” data across users allows adaptive sampling algorithms to potentially learn faster. However, by pooling, these algorithms induce dependence between the collected user data trajectories; this makes statistical inference on this data-type especially challenging. We provide methods to perform a variety of statistical analyses on such adaptively collected data, including Z-estimation, off-policy analyses, and inferring excursion effects. This work is motivated by our work in designing experiments in which online reinforcement learning algorithms pool data across users to learn to optimize treatment decisions, yet reliable statistical inference is essential for conducting a variety of statistical analyses after the experiment is over.</p>
