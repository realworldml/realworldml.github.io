title: ProbNumDiffEq.jl
short-description: Probabilistic numerical ODE solvers in Julia.
description: ProbNumDiffEq.jl provides probabilistic numerical ODE solvers to the DifferentialEquations.jl ecosystem. The implemented ODE filters solve differential equations via Bayesian filtering and smoothing and compute not just a single point estimate of the true solution, but a posterior distribution that contains an estimate of its numerical approximation error.
