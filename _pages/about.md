This website aims to be a resource for researchers from academia and industry to collect
major challenges, outline recent advances, and highlight promising future directions
pertaining to real-world experimental design and active learning problems.

It aims to highlight new and emerging research opportunities for the machine learning
community that arise from the evolving needs to make experimental design and active
learning procedures that are theoretically and practically relevant for realistic
applications. Progress in this area has the potential to provide immense benefits in
emerging high impact applications, such as **materials design**, **drug discovery**,
**algorithm configuration**, **crowdsourcing**, **citizen science**, **computational
biology**, **AutoML**, **robotics**, **reinforcement learning**, and more.
