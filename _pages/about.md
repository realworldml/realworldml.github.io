This website aims to be a resource for researchers from academia and industry to collect
major challenges, outline recent advances, and highlight promising future directions
pertaining to real-world experimental design and active learning problems. We organize
both [workshops](workshops) and a [talk series](seminars).

## Overview

Whether in robotics, protein design, or physical sciences, one often faces decisions
regarding which data to collect or which experiments to perform. There is thus a
pressing need for algorithms that make intelligent decisions about data collection
processes that allow for data-efficient learning. Experimental design and active
learning have been major research topics within both machine learning and statistics
communities.

This website aims to highlight new and emerging research opportunities that arise from
the need make experimental design and active learning procedures that are effective in
realistic applications.  Progress in this area has the potential to provide immense
benefits in emerging high impact applications, such as **materials design**, **drug
discovery**, **algorithm configuration**, **crowdsourcing**, **citizen science**,
**computational biology**, **AutoML**, **robotics**, **reinforcement learning**, and
more.
