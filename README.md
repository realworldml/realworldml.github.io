# Website of the Probabilistic Numerics Community

This repository contains the source files for [probabilistic-numerics.org](probabilistic-numerics.org), the website of the **Probabilistic Numerics** research field.

## Requesting Changes

You can request features or report bugs by creating an [issue](https://github.com/probabilistic-numerics/website/issues). Be aware that your requested change has much higher probability of being considered if you suggest it directly via a pull request (see contribution guide below).

## Contributing

The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [al-folio theme](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio). Bibliography support is provided by [Jekyll-Scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar).
