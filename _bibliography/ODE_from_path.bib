abstract={A Bayesian statistical model and estimation methodology based on
                  forward projection adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo is
                  developed in order to perform the calibration of a
                  high-dimensional nonlinear system of ordinary differential
                  equations representing an epidemic model for human
                  papillomavirus types 6 and 11 (HPV-6, HPV-11). The model is
                  compartmental and involves stratification by age, gender and
                  sexual-activity group. Developing this model and a means to
                  calibrate it efficiently is relevant because HPV is a very
                  multi-typed and common sexually transmitted infection with
                  more than 100 types currently known. The two types studied in
                  this paper, types 6 and 11, are causing about 90\% of
                  anogenital warts. We extend the development of a sexual
                  mixing matrix on the basis of a formulation first suggested
                  by Garnett and Anderson, frequently used to model sexually
                  transmitted infections. In particular, we consider a
                  stochastic mixing matrix framework that allows us to jointly
                  estimate unknown attributes and parameters of the mixing
                  matrix along with the parameters involved in the calibration
                  of the HPV epidemic model. This matrix describes the sexual
                  interactions between members of the population under study
                  and relies on several quantities that are a priori
                  unknown. The Bayesian model developed allows one to estimate
                  jointly the HPV-6 and HPV-11 epidemic model parameters as
                  well as unknown sexual mixing matrix parameters related to
                  assortativity. Finally, we explore the ability of an
                  extension to the class of adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo
                  algorithms to incorporate a forward projection strategy for
                  the ordinary differential equation state
                  trajectories. Efficient exploration of the Bayesian posterior
                  distribution developed for the ordinary differential equation
                  parameters provides a challenge for any Markov chain sampling
                  methodology, hence the interest in adaptive Markov chain
                  methods. We conclude with simulation studies on synthetic and
                  recent actual data.},

                  differential equations (ODEs) is challenging due to the high

                  matching a separate data model is introduced with the
                  property that its gradient may be calculated
                  easily. Parameter estimation is then achieved by requiring
                  consistency between the gradients computed from the data
                  model and those specified by the ODE. We propose a Gaussian
                  process model that directly links state derivative
                  information with system observations, simplifying previous
                  approaches and improving estimation accuracy.}

  abstract = {Gradient matching is a promising tool for learning parameters and state dynamics of ordinary differential equations. It is a grid free inference approach, which, for fully observable systems is at times competitive with numerical integration. However, for many real-world applications, only sparse observations are available or even unobserved variables are included in the model description. In these cases most gradient matching methods are difficult to apply or simply do not provide satisfactory results. That is why, despite the high computational cost, numerical integration is still the gold standard in many applications. Using an existing gradient matching approach, we propose a scalable variational inference framework which can infer states and parameters simultaneously, offers computational speedups, improved accuracy and works well even under model misspecifications in a partially observable system.}
